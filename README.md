# CovidDetector
Covid-19 detector algorithm 
This code implements logistic regression on COVID-19 symptom data to predict whether individuals are affected by COVID-19. 
It utilizes the scikit-learn library to split the data into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

The code also visualizes the confusion matrix using Matplotlib.
